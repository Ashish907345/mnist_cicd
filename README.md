# ML Model CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a simple CNN model for MNIST digit classification with a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

```

## Model Architecture

The project implements a simple CNN with:
- 2 convolutional layers (16 and 32 filters)
- 2 max pooling layers
- 2 fully connected layers (128 units and 10 outputs)
- ReLU activation functions

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9.0+
- torchvision 0.10.0+
- pytest 6.2.5+

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

5. Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline automatically:
1. Sets up Python environment
2. Installs dependencies
3. Trains the model for 1 epoch
4. Runs tests to verify:
   - Model has less than 100,000 parameters
   - Model accepts 28x28 input and outputs 10 classes
   - Model achieves >80% accuracy on test set
5. Archives the trained model as an artifact

## Model Artifacts

Trained models are saved with timestamps in the `models/` directory with the format:
```
model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pth
```

## Test Details

The pipeline runs three main tests:

1. Parameter Count Test
   - Ensures model has fewer than 100,000 parameters
   - Checks model complexity and memory requirements

2. Input/Output Shape Test
   - Verifies model accepts 28x28 MNIST images
   - Confirms output is 10 classes (digits 0-9)

3. Accuracy Test
   - Loads latest trained model
   - Evaluates on MNIST test set
   - Ensures accuracy exceeds 80%

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The pipeline is triggered on every push to the repository. You can monitor the workflow:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. View the latest workflow run
4. Download trained model artifacts if needed

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- If tests fail, check the model training logs in GitHub Actions
- Ensure CUDA is available if using GPU locally
- Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
- Check if models directory exists before running tests
